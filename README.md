# C_programming 
It is a directory of C Programming language that will help people to revise C programming language at a glance.

After my graduation, I have seen my coding skill is not good enough to join any software company. So I have decided to practice all the programming languages that I have
learned in my university life.For this reason, I have started to learn C programming language first.Here is my C language code directory.Anyone can see this directory or can
contribute to this directory.But I will discourage the beginner who has less knowledge about programming or keywords of C programming language.This directory will help more 
who has good knowledge about the C programming language and want to revise C language at a glance.


Warning: please do the programming contest or practice coding regularly to improve your skill in programming. There are many websites to practice coding. You can practice coding
in http://codeforces.com/, https://www.codechef.com/, https://vjudge.net/ etc. You can also find other websites by searching on google.


Stay healty and start coding.
